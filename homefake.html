            <p id="mission_statement">Perspective was started by high schoolers through Girls Who Code for their final project. As teenagers living in the U.S, we wanted to make resources available to other teenagers about the issues that affect us the most, specifically alcohol and marijuana usage, consent, and the Black Lives Matter movement. When using other resources about these subjects, we noticed that most if not all were written from the perspective of someone that was not a high school student. This did not help us because they did not understand what we as teenagers were going through. Through this website we hope to create a safe environment to discuss race, consent, alcohol and drugs.</p>
